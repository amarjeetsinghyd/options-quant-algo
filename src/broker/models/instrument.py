"""Universal instrument model used across the platform.

Each broker provides its own instrument identifiers (tokens).  The adapter
converts those identifiers into a *universal* representation that downstream
components can rely on.  The universal model deliberately does **not** expose
broker‑specific tokens – they are stored internally for the adapter’s use only.
